# RegexGenerator
### Regex Generator In Python
---

Regular expressions (Regex) are patterns that match character combinations in strings. 
Regexes can be utilized as a powerful mechanism for solving string-matching problems and are supported by all modern programming languages. <br>
This project provides a library in python that generates regular expressions with functional abstractions hiding all the complexities of reading and writing regexes. 
This library enables end users to write Regex without being burdened by the complexities of the symbols of the Regex.

## Objectives aimed to be achieved 
1. Design a regex builder that makes reading and writing regex easy.
2. Provide abstractions so that no one has to remember regex syntax.
3. Make Regex understandable, shareable, and built at runtime.

## Documentation
Our documentation can be found [here](https://sms-org.github.io/RegexGenerator/regex.html).

## Installation
