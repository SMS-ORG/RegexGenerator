# RegexGenerator
#### Regex Generator In Python
---

> Regular expressions (Regex) are patterns that match character combinations in strings. Regexes can be utilized as a powerful mechanism for solving string-matching problems and are supported by all modern programming languages. <br>
> This project aims to provide a library in python that will generate regular expressions with functional abstractions hiding all the complexities of reading and writing regexes. This library aims to enable end users to write Regex without being burdened by the complexities of the symbols of the Regex.

## Objectives aimed to be achieved 
1. Design a regex builder that makes reading and writing regex easy.
2. Provide abstractions so that no one has to remember regex syntax.
3. Make Regex understandable, shareable, and built at runtime.
